# BurgerApp - ExpressJS/Sequelize and MySQL/Handlebars

Homework 12, A full stack app using SQL, NodeJS (ExpressJS), and Handlebars.

## About this app 

This simple web-application uses ExpressJS to create a server and handle routing. It uses Sequelize to handle database queries and create a functional API. 

Handlebars takes care of the dynamic HTML building!

## Fully RESTful API

Built into the back-end is a fully RESTful API which supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) opperations.
